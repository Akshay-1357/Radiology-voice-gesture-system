# 🏥 Touchless Radiology AI System  
### *Like Iron Man, but for Doctors.* 🦸‍♂️🩻  

Welcome to the **Radiology Voice & Gesture System**!  
We built this because touching buttons in a hospital isn't just boring—it's unhygienic. This tool lets radiologists control imaging systems completely **hands-free** using just their voice and hand movements.

## ✨ Features  
- **✋ Hand Gestures:** Wave, show a peace sign, or give a thumbs up to control the scanner. No keyboard needed.  
- **🗣️ Voice Commands:** Just say *"Start Scan"* or *"Emergency Stop"*. It listens (and understands fuzzy commands too!).  
- **🖥️ Sci-Fi Dashboard:** A beautiful, dark-mode glassmorphism interface that looks straight out of a movie.  
- **🤖 Smart Safety:** Won't let you stop a scan that hasn't started. It knows the rules.
